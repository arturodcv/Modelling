Program of the wave equation for the PDE course made by Arturo del Cerro (NIU 1593930).

The 'wave_eq.c' file is the C program that compile and execute the wave equation problem. 
Inside this file you will find the instructions to execute it correctly. When executing it, you will
find in your working directory an 'output.txt' file that contents the results as requested.

Extra:
The 'results.py' file is a Python file that creates a video of how the string evolves when time passes.
The 'results.mp4' file is an example of the output that the Python program creates.
